what is flexbox ?
** Flexbox uses two types of boxes that we’ve never seen before: “flex containers” and “flex items”. The job of a flex container is to group a bunch of flex items together and define how they’re positioned. **

what is flex property on flex items ?
**Flex is a shorthand for 3 property that we set on flex item, the properies affect how flex items size themselves within their container.

we use flex property on flex items to determine how will the individual items will grow and shrink with the change in the width of their parent container.
Flex is a shorthand for flex-grow,flex-shrink,flex-grow 

flex: 1 equates to: flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0.

** flex-basis **
flex-basis sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size. 

The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%. The reason we had to change it to auto in the flex-shrink example is that with the basis set to 0, those items would ignore the item’s width, and everything would shrink evenly.

Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration (width: 250px).
