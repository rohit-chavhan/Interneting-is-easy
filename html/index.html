  <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
  <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>Heading define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>
  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>This is how you make an unordered list</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>This is what an ordered list looks like:</ol>
  <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
  <li>But, the list item elements are the shame</li>
  <li>Also note how the numbers increments on their own</li>
  <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>

  <H2>Inline Elements</H2>

  <p><em>Sometimes,</em>you nedd to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
  <p>Other items, you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>

  <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

  <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
